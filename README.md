## Abstract

Controlling a six-axis arm efficiently requires seamless synchronization between real-time feedback and simulation. Our developed dashboard, crafted using Qt C and QML, empowers users to manipulate the movements of a six-axis arm effortlessly. With real-time feedback displayed on the dashboard, users can visualize and fine-tune the arm's actions, enhancing precision and control.

The dashboard facilitates individual axis control, allowing users to adjust speed and direction dynamically. Additionally, automation features enable users to train the robot for repetitive tasks, optimizing efficiency and productivity.

Requirements include Ubuntu 20, Qt 5.12, LAN driver enabled with IP 192.168.56.1 in Windows 10 or above, and Jetson 4GB kit with Jetpack 4 and Qt 5-default.

This abstract encapsulates the essence of our six-axis arm control dashboard, showcasing its capabilities in providing real-time feedback, individual axis manipulation, and automation functionalities.
